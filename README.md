# EggCode's syntax

### Main syntax

func [function name] - creates/starts new function called [function name]
[function name].end - ends [function name]
[function name].start - runs/starts [function name]

print([input]) - outputs [input]

[a] = [b] - creates new varible named [a] with tthe value [b]

### Input syntax

print([varible name]) - gets [varible name]'s value
print("[string]") - returns [string]
[varible] = math([a] +,-,*,/ [b]) - returns [a] plus/minus/times/divided by [b]

### Notes

* math() dose not work as an input with print() currently
